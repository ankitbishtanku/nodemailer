Project Overview: Email Notification System using Node.js and Nodemailer

Developed an email notification system using Node.js and Nodemailer, featuring user registration, login, and email functionality. The system sends HTML email templates containing JSON Web Tokens (JWT) with embedded user information for secure and personalized communication.

Key Features:

-User Registration and Login: Implemented secure user authentication and authorization using Passport.js and bcrypt for password hashing.

-Email Sending: Integrated Nodemailer to send emails upon user registration and other events.

-HTML Email Templates: Designed and sent HTML email templates to users, enhancing the email content with professional and dynamic layouts.

-JWT Integration: Embedded JSON Web Tokens (JWT) within the HTML email templates to securely transmit user information. The JWT ensures data integrity and confidentiality.

-Database Integration: Utilized MongoDB with Mongoose for storing user data and managing application state.
-Error Handling: Implemented comprehensive error handling mechanisms to ensure reliability and ease of debugging.

Technologies Used:

-Backend: Node.js, Express.js

-Email Service: Nodemailer

-Authentication: Passport.js, bcrypt, JSON Web Token (JWT)

-Database: MongoDB, Mongoose

-Frontend: HTML, CSS for email templates

-Version Control: Git, GitHub


This project showcases my ability to develop secure and efficient backend systems, implement robust email functionalities with dynamic content, and use JWT for secure data transmission within emails.
